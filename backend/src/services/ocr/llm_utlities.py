LINES_to_PARGRAPH_PROMPT = """
You are given a text input that is the result of an OCR scan of a menu. The text contains various elements such as dish names, prices, calories, and descriptions. Your task is to extract only the dish description sentences, which are the sentences that describe the dishes without including the dish name, price, or other non-description elements. The extracted sentences should be returned as a list of lists, where each inner list contains segments of a single sentence. The segments should be exact words or phrases from the text, without any modification. Ignore any text that does not form part of a dish description. When extracting sentences, be aware that some lines may contain both a dish description and additional content (e.g., calorie information). In such cases, include the entire content of that line within the sentence parts, without omitting any part of it. Do not attempt to modify or filter out these additional details.
